# Twitter Clone

I made twitter clone with nextjs. I focused on new app directory and server/client component futures. This new backend on fronted approach with server components makes creating full-stack aps so easy and provides more performance. For better User Exp. I render first states on backend and get html then i manage state with react-query the way i manage single page apps.

**route: / (root path)**: here i get data on backend and generate initial posts (like 10 posts) and render for initial html. So when user visit this route, user sees initial posts directly as i show on preview video. Then i manage query and action with react-query especially infiniteQuery(infinite scroll) to render more posts.

**route: /post/[postid]**: this dynamic route displays a spesific post and comments. I rendered this posts by just one component named TweetDisplay. I rendered recursively. It could be infinite comments. All componenst have their own seperated states includes react-query states.

**route: /user/[userid]/[tweets-type]**: This route takes two dynamic path: userid and tweets-type. tweets-type is to list selected menu on navbar under profile informations. default path is [user-tweets] when click Likes on navbar it will be user/uid/user-likes. i saw it on twitter and implemented this project. Here also i render initial posts on server and manage posts same way as i manage posts root path.
