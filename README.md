# Twitter Clone

I have created a Twitter clone using Next.js. I have focused on the new app directory structure and server/client component features. This new approach of using server components in the frontend makes it easy to create full-stack apps and provides better performance. To enhance the user experience, I render the initial states on the backend and retrieve the HTML, then I manage the state with react-query, similar to how I manage single-page apps.

**route: / (root path)**: Here, I fetch the data on the backend and generate initial posts (around 10 posts) to render them in the initial HTML. When a user visits this route, they will see the initial posts directly, as shown in the preview video. Then, I manage the queries and actions with react-query, especially infiniteQuery (infinite scroll), to render more posts.

**route: /post/[postid]**: This dynamic route displays a specific post and its comments. I render these posts using a single component called TweetDisplay, which I render recursively. There could be infinite comments. All components have their own separate states, including react-query states.

**route: /user/[userid]/[tweets-type]**: This route takes two dynamic paths: userid and tweets-type. The tweets-type is used to list the selected menu on the navbar under profile information. The default path is [user-tweets]. When the user clicks on "Likes" in the navbar, the path will be user/uid/user-likes. I saw this on Twitter and implemented it in this project. Here, I also render initial posts on the server and manage the posts in the same way as I manage the posts in the root path.

**route: /search**: This is the search page to find users based on their display name and username.
